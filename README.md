## Expression of Interest : CY P09-23-10

## Project Aim

The aim of this exploratory study is to use ‘Environmental Indicators’ data (that measure factors like air pollution, greenspace, public transport, walkability, traffic, built environment, food accessibility, etc.) to better understand the impacts of the physical environment on outcomes in the domains of crime, education and health.
The project is part of the Vulnerability and Policing Futures Research Centre (VPRC).
